### What I learned

This challenge required me to learn about SVG importing and dynamically displaying SVGâ€™s that are various sizes. While it is rather straight forward to import individual assets in a React project, this is a more difficult task when you have many assets. This is further compounded when you want to dynamically use said assets. I ended up with a couple of very useful hooks and a reusable SVG component that provided a more elegant solution. The result was much more reusable and easier to implement.

Also, in this project I modified the data.json file to add planet colors and SVG base sizes to aid in dynamically changing theme colors and correctly sizing planet graphics.

<!-- Raster image import hook -->

```js
function importAll(r) {
  let images = {}
  r.keys().map((item) => {
    images[item.replace('./', '')] = r(item)
  })
  return images
}

export const images = importAll(
  require.context('../assets', true, /\.(png|jpe?g|svg)$/)
)
```

<!-- Vector image import hook -->

```js
import { useRef } from 'react'

export default function useDynamicSVGImport(name) {
  const ImportedIconRef = useRef()
  ImportedIconRef.current = name

  return { SvgIcon: ImportedIconRef.current }
}
```

<!-- Vector image component -->

```js
export default function Svg({ name, onCompleted, onError, ...rest }) {
  const { SvgIcon } = useDynamicSVGImport(name)

  if (SvgIcon) {
    return <SvgIcon {...rest} />
  }
  return null
}
```
